also flags the buffer modified and `save-buffer'.  Calling the
second `org-roam-backlink-collections-remove-all' ensures the clearing process
to occur.  This is reqiured because during live-sync, some hooks
that manage the clearing process are temporarily turned
off (removed)."

  ;; by the buffer. If a "temp" buffer, there is no file being visited.
